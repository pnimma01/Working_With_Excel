#  Kickstarting with Excel

##  Overview of Project

This data analysis is performed to determinie the success criteria based on the timing of release and funding goals.

##  Purpose

The success of an initiative depends on lot of variables, and it is extremely critical to time the release of any product, the purpose of this project is to analyze historical data and present it in such a way that the stakeholders can easily visualize the data to make important decisions.

##  Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch dates:

Following line graph provides visual representation of the outcome based on launch date.

Based on the line graph, it becomes imperative that very high volume of plays release between March and September,and become susccessful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Following line graph provides visual representation of the outcome based on launch date.

Base on the line graph, the chances of a successful launch decrese as the goal amount increases where the goal is upto $25,0000. The shows where the goal is between $35,000 to $45,000 are hugely successful too.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1. For deliverable #2 "**Outcomes Based on Goals**" value of $50,000 is not included in the goal category list, I included it by adding >=50,000.

2. The Goal categorization could be provided as data, instead of an image, as it could result in typos and waste of time.

## Results

**We could draw following conclusions based on "Outcomes based on Launch Date"**
1. High volume of shows release between Apr and Sept.
2. Shows that release between Apr and Sept are hugely successful.

**We could draw following conclusion based on "Outcomes based on Goals"**
1. The lower the goal amount, the higher the chances that the show is successful, for goals upto $25,000

**Following are some of the limitations of this dataset**
1. The data is not the latest data, it includes the data upto year 2017.
2. The data is not exhaustive, it is very limited.
